            <dd> <strong>respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that
                    help you breathe.</strong>
                It includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that
                power your lungs
                are also part of the respiratory system. These parts work together
                to move oxygen
                throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide. </dd>

                mouth and continues through the airways and the lungs. </em> Air enters the respiratory
                system through the nose and mouth and passes down the throat (pharynx) and through
                the voice box, or larynx. The entrance to the larynx is covered by a small flap of
                tissue, the epiglottis, that automatically closes during swallowing, thus preventing
                food or drink from entering the </dd>


            reproductive system
            <dd> <strong>
                    (REE-proh-DUK-tiv SIS-tem) The tissues, glands, and organs involved in producing
                    offspring (children). In women, the reproductive system includes the ovaries, the
                    fallopian tubes, the uterus, the cervix, and the vagina. In men, it includes the prostate,
                    the testes, and the penis.
                    Production of reproductive cells and contribution towards</strong>
                    the reproduction process.</dd>
            <dd> This system is related to the production of offspring. It includes ovaries,
                uterus,
                mammary glands (breasts), penis, and testes. The reproductive system is not
                essential
                to individual survival, but it is essential for the survival of the species. </dd>

            nervous systems
            <dd>
                The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, and a complex network of nerves.
                This system sends messages back and forth between the brain and the body. The brain
                is what controls all the body's functions. The spinal cord runs from the brain down
                through the back.</dd>
            <em> The nervous system allows us to sensory
                stimuli as light, sound, smell, and touch from our environment.</em> </dd>
            <dd> It also allows rapid communication of stimuli within our body, such as sensations
                ofpain, illness, and wellness.
                The nervous system accomplishes all of this using highly specialized cells called
                neurons, which can transmit signals extremely fast by firing electrochemical potentials.</dd>
